# Netflix-Dashboard
I worked on a simple yet insightful project analyzing Netflix’s content library. I used Python for cleaning the data and Tableau to create a clear and interactive dashboard. Here’s what I discovered:

-Movies vs. TV Shows: Movies are leading, but TV shows aren’t far behind!

-Top Genres: Comedy and Drama are dominating, with International content growing fast.

-Leading Countries: The US takes the top spot, followed by India and the UK.

-Age Ratings: There’s a strong focus on TV-MA, but Netflix offers content for everyone.

-Content Growth: The biggest growth happened between 2015 and 2020!



My Recommendations for Deeper Insights:

Analyze audience engagement for different genres (which movie or show is the most popular?).

Compare content trends across countries (what works best in each region?).

Study the impact of Netflix Originals on this rapid growth.
